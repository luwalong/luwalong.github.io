I"¨$<p>Logistic regression and GLM are somehow direct extension from the linear regression
so I skip the post about those. Instead, in this post, we will take a look for
another simple yet powerful method, <em>decision tree</em>. After we go through the basic
of the decision tree, we will also take a look for the paper named ‚ÄúNeural-Backed 
Decision Trees‚Äù, which proposes the hybrid approach of decision tree and neural
network.</p>

<h2 id="decision-trees">Decision trees</h2>

<p>The name itself of decision tree says quite much about the algorithm. Decision 
tree consists of a tree-like decision process and let the data follow the distinct
route from the root to the terminal/leaf node. Each terminal node is classified
as a single label.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is the formal statement of inference in the decision tree.</p>

\[\hat{y} = \hat{f}(x) = \sum^{M}_{m=1} c_m I_{ \{ x \in R_m \} }\]

<p>As mentioned earlier, each instance falls in to the unique leaf node($R_m$) with
the class label (or the average value) of $c_m$. 
There are several algorithms to build a tree on a dataset,
but let‚Äôs focus on CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm in this
post.</p>

<h3 id="building-algorithm--cart">Building algorithm ‚Äì CART</h3>

<p>CART decides how to split the data based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity">Gini impurity</a>.
Gini impurity given set is calculated by the sum of the multiplication of <em>correctly classified 
probability</em> ($p_i$) and <em>wrongly classified probability</em> ($\sum_{k \neq i} p_k = 1 - p_i$).</p>

\[I_G(p) = \sum^J_{i=1} p_i \left( \sum^J_{k=1} p_k \right) = \sum^J_{i=1} p_i (1-p_i) = 1 - \sum^J_{i=1} p^2_i\]

<p>Based on this measure, CART splits the given data by minimising the impurity
of the resulting nodes. This applies both for the continuous and categorical 
features.</p>

<h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h3>

<p>Interpretation of the decision tree is pretty simple: you only need to follow 
the conditions written on the intermediate nodes and make inference by the
representative label of the terminal node where the instance eventually placed.
Decision tree is the most human-friendly method to build the interpretable model
and relatively fast to create the model.</p>

<p>In addition to the vanilla decision tree, we can extend the concept to <em>random
forest</em> technique. This is out of scope of this post, but keep in mind that the
extended method is the ensemble method with several decision trees on the subset
of the dataset.</p>

<h3 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and cons</h3>

<p>Here goes the list of the pros of decision trees:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Good for capturing interactions</strong> between features in the data. This is not
quantitatibly done but by the interpreter‚Äôs signts.</li>
  <li><strong>So easy interpretation</strong> even on the multidimesional data.</li>
  <li><strong>Has natural visualisation</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Creates good explanations</strong>. Following the route itself already produces 
natural explanations for the inference.</li>
  <li><strong>No need of transformation</strong> of the features unlike the linear regression.</li>
</ul>

<p>and cons:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Fails to deal with linear relationships</strong>. Decision trees only split the data
based on the step function. This eventually results in the <strong>lack of smoothness</strong>
in the infefence. This can be alleviated by using <em>oblique</em> decision trees, the
structure using non-orthogonal decision boundaries.</li>
  <li><strong>Unstable structure</strong>. Even the slightest change in the training dataset can 
devastating change in the resulting tree. For the robust decision trees, check 
this out<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
  <li><strong>The number of terminal nodes increases quickly with depth</strong>. The maximum number
of leaves increases exponentially as the depth grows.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="neural-backed-decision-trees">Neural-backed decision trees</h2>

<p>As briefly shown before, decision trees are easy to build and easy to interpret,
but certainly have their limitations. Wan et al.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> wanted to maintain the good
things from the decision trees for the concurrent models, so they designed
NBDT; the hybrid approach of neural networks and decision trees to boost the 
interpretability of the high-end classifiers. Their intuitition is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs) replace a network‚Äôs final linear layer with a decision tree.
Unlike classical decision trees or many hierarchical classifiers, NBDTs use path probabilities for
inference (Sec 3.1) to tolerate highly-uncertain intermediate decisions, build a hierarchy from 
pretrained model weights (Sec 3.2 &amp; 3.3) to lessen overfitting, and train with a hierarchical loss
(Sec 3.4) to significantly better learn high-level decisions (e.g., Animal vs. Vehicle).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="inference">Inference</h3>

<p>Let $W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$ be the weight matrix of the final fully-connected 
layer of the pre-trained neural network. Denote the row vector of $W$ as $w_i$.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Seed oblique decision rule weights with neural network weights.</strong> Fix the 
structure of the decision tree shape with the complete binary tree, and allocate
the row vectors $w_i$ to each leaf node. For the intermediate nodes, set with
the average weight vector of all the leaf nodes in the subtree rooted by that
node, i.e., \(w'_i = \frac{1}{|L(i)|} \sum_{j \in L(i)} w_j\)</li>
  <li><strong>Compute node probabilities.</strong> For each sample $x$, node $i$, and its child $j \in C(i)$,
\(p(j|i) = \texttt{Softmax}(n_i^{\intercal} x) [j], \text{ where } n_i = (w_j^{\intercal} x)_{j \in C(i)}.\)</li>
  <li><strong>Pick a leaf using path probabilities.</strong> Denote the next traversal node of $i$ as $C_k(i)$ on the existing path $P_k$.
Then $C_k(i) \in P_k \cap C(i)$. The probability of the leaf node labeled $k$ is:
\(p(k) = \prod_{i \in P_k} p(C_k(i) | i).\)
After that, the final class prediction $\hat{k}$ is calculated as the argmax of
all the leaf node probabilities.</li>
</ol>

<p>The authors claim that this approach is the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù decision process as all the
leaf nodes are considered in probabilistic way, and more robust to the early
mistakes happening on the shallow nodes.</p>

<h3 id="building-induced-hierarchies">Building induced hierarchies</h3>

<p>After it, the author takes the strategy to build hierarchy structure by clustering
algorithm based on the normalised assigned weights, $w_k / |w_k|_2$. The implementation
shows they applied k-nn clustering for this.</p>

<h3 id="labeling-decision-nodes-with-wordnet">Labeling decision nodes with WordNet</h3>

<p>Then they labeled each intermediate nodes by finding the common ancestor of two
nodes in the WordNet. This is for semantically plausible purpose for the interpretation.</p>

<h3 id="fine-tuning-with-tree-supervision-loss">Fine-tuning with tree supervision loss</h3>

<p>They suggested a new loss named tree supervision loss by combining the original
cross entropy loss for the classification and the additional term of cross entropy
on the $p(k)$. The weights for each term changes along the training stage.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2021-06-19-ambiguous.png" alt="ambiguous images" /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Types of ambiguous labels. NBDT explains which node is ambiguous and not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Overally, NBDT shows impressive results. They showed that with the very slight
drop of accuracy, NBDT produces much reasonable explanations for the predictions.
Since, as you know, there is no way to quantitatively measure the explanability,
the authors performed several surveys to human pool, including above interesting
experiments.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>

<p>We took a look for the decision trees and their modern application, NBDT. This
simple yet powerful method is still widely used in the field, so worth be
acknowledged. As the authors of NBDT confessed, the method has a weak chain between
the induced hierarchy and labeling it. It would be nice further research to make
logical grips on that ambiguous part to make NBDT better.</p>
