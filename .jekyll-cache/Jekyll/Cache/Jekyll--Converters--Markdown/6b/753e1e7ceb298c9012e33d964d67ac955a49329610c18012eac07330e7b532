I"<p>Hello stranger,</p>

<p>I’m happy to announce that I’m joining <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> from this
Autumn! I’ll be part of the Quora ML team as a Machine Learning Engineer. Honestly
I enjoyed all the unique processes of the interviews and the life in Quora will be
as exciting as those experiences. I can’t still believe myself to be hired by the
reknowned Silicon Valley company but slowly am realising it by my future co-workers’
warm and kind welcomes. Cannot thank more to Hwan-Seung for introducing me the
wonderful opportunity.</p>

<p>I’ll be located in Vancouver with my wife and start to work remotely, probably 
from August. The only thing left for me now is successfully graduating from 
ETH Zürich :) Wish me luck!</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
