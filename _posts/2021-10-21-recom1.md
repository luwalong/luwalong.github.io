Long time no see - it has been a month since I started my work in Quora. I
started my ML Engineer position at Distribution team, which is highly related
to the content recommendations. Speaking of recomendation, I would like to
introduce the **two-tower model**[^1], which is a part of the (almost)
industry-standard architecture for any recommendation systems.

## Overview

Modern recommendation systems consist of two main pillars - (i) retrieval and
(ii) ranking. The first part is to choose which items to be shown to the user,
and the second part is to order them up by some scoring criteria. Since there
are tons of items (at least for those major services) ranking all of them is
unreasonable, and showing all the chosen items simultaneously is also absurd
idea. Hence, splitting the whole system into two parts is somehow natural
consequence of the system design. Please let me know if you come up with more
clever idea:)

## What is Two-tower model?

So two-tower model is for the item retrieval. It seems to have two somethings,
then what are those? Recall the objective of the recommendation system -
showing the relevant *items* to each *user*. Those italic terms are the names of
those two towers. By getting two encoded vectors from both item and user, we get the
score of the match by *dot product*. Below is the great visualisation of Google.

We could know many things about items, and surely, if consented to give their
information to us, about users as well. Not only we have the object ids, we have
basic statistics, history, tags, followed entities, activities, and so many
data. *Features* from the above image contains those information. Since the
definition of the towers is quite flexible, it's totally up to the designer who
knows the specifics of the data. Fyi: Quora also has continuously improving
features to make the recommendation better ðŸ˜Ž.

## How to train the model?

I guess this is not restricted to the Two-tower, but Gaurav[^2] made a nice
explanation about how to train the recommendation system. We basically want
higher scores to highly related item-user pairs, and lower scores to
seemingly-not-matching pairs. From the history, we need to get **positive
examples** and **negative examples** to train the model with balance.

*Positive examples* are exactly what you're thinking. Regarding the target
metric, any positive action between a user and an item can be a positive
example. Not only the clicked items, but also for the items which got enough
reading time, or upvoted items (sorry for Quora-specific examples) can all be in
this group.

*Negative examples*, however, are quite opposite. We need this pool of data
since we should **not to recommend** the irrelevant items to a user. If we only
use the positive examples to train, then the model will just recommend any item
since it doesn't know what pairs are less related. There are two main approaches
to compose the negative examples: *candidate sampling* and *negative
impressions*. The former is the randomly picked items not watched by the user,
and the latter is the items which are represented to the user by the system, yet
not chosen. Guarav says:
> Typically the first approach, negative sampling works better in the initial stages. Once the model has already reached a high level of recall, a bit of negative impression based training might further improve the model. Just using impressions might not work.

Sleek strategy, isn't it?

## Afterword

Two-tower model is quite a huge concept and can versatilely be applied to
different systems. I'll try to go through the recommendation systems of some
major companies use. Until then!
