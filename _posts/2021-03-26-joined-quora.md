Hello stranger,

I'm happy to announce that I'm joining [Quora](https://www.quora.com/) from this
Autumn! I'll be part of the Quora ML team as a Machine Learning Engineer. Honestly
I enjoyed all the unique processes of the interviews and the life in Quora will be
as exciting as those experiences. I can't still believe myself to be hired by the
reknowned Silicon Valley company but slowly am realising it by my future co-workers'
warm and kind welcomes. Cannot thank more to Hwan-Seung for introducing me the
wonderful opportunity. 

I'll be located in Vancouver with my wife and start to work remotely, probably 
from August. The only thing left for me now is successfully graduating from 
ETH ZÃ¼rich :) Wish me luck!

Until next time!
